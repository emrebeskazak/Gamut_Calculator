# Gamut_Calculator

This is a chromacity diagram plotter and area calculator graphical user interface windows application aiming people who work on displays. The application can plot two gamuts comparatively in a CIE 1931 xy or CIE 1976 u'v' chromacity diagram and, calculate the gamut areas ratios and the gamuts area coverage. User can provide xy coordinates of RGB chromacities or a back light unit (BLU) spectrum file without LCD cell filter file or BLU spectrum file with LCD cell filter file (recommended) to the application for either two gamuts. 
It is written in Python by using open source modules. It is not a completed software and it need tons of bug fixes and more compatibilities regarding imported files. Also, some may want to add other standard colour spaces to default options (which is pretty easy thanks to colour-science module). Please feel free to use, share and contribute to the project.
